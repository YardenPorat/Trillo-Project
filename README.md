# Trillo-Project
This is a website for booking made in my `Sass` Study.
## Introduction
This project has the purpose to show some `Sass` and `CSS3` features and provide a ready template that could be adapted to any landing page you want.
## Requirements
  - Node and NPM installed on machine. To see if you have it installed, use the code under and you should see something like this:
  ```sh
  $ node -v
  v8.11.3
  $ npm -v
  6.2.0
  ```
## Building this project for production
  - **Install Dependencies** - You need to run `npm install` to use the required librarys
  ```sh
  $ npm install
  ```
  - **Run the build:css script** -  In the `package.json` you'll se some scripts that compile the code, adding and compressing the sass files to better performance and optimization.
    ```sh
    $ npm run build:css
    ```
  - **Get the compiled result** - When the build is complete, it will generate a `style.css` in de `css/` folder, that you could use in your applications.
## Important Note
This landing page was originally build by **Jonas Schmedtmann**, a great teacher in Udemy, who made this site for his online course. 
Despite that I have made a few changes in the code, the role creation **is assigned to Jonas Schmedtmann**.
